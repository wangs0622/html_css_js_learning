# Introduction

First I download the html file and css file from [http://www.w3school.com.cn](http://www.w3school.com.cn); those files this saved as "w3school.html" and "c5.css".Then I copy teo files and named as "w3school-withnotes.html" and "c5-withnote.css". In the files with notes, I will write my opinion on each sectence. So in the files "w3school-withnotes.html" and "c5-withnote.css", there would be many places that offend against the rules of grammar. But don't care it, those two files is used to read not to run.

首先就是下载网页的源代码，保存为了 "w3school.html" 和 "c5.css"。然后 copy 一份，命名为 "w3school-withnotes.html" 和 "c5-withnote.css"。在复制的文件中，我在每行下写下自己的注释。所有在这两个文件中会有很多的地方不符合语法规则，不过不要紧，毕竟这两个文件是用来看的，不是用来运行的。
